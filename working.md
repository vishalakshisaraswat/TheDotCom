# AI/ML techniques commonly used in online matchmaking platforms like Shaadi.com:

# Collaborative Filtering: 
This technique is widely used in recommendation systems. It involves making automatic predictions (filtering) about the interests of a user by collecting preferences from many users (collaborating). In the context of Shaadi.com, collaborative filtering could be used to suggest potential matches based on the preferences and behaviors of similar users.

# Content-Based Filtering:
 This method recommends items or users similar to what the user has liked or interacted with in the past. For Shaadi.com, it could involve suggesting matches based on the characteristics and preferences specified in a user's profile.

# Natural Language Processing (NLP):
 NLP techniques can be used to analyze and understand the textual information provided in user profiles, such as interests, hobbies, and personal descriptions. This information can then be used to match users with similar interests or personalities.

# Machine Learning Models:
 Shaadi.com likely employs various machine learning models to predict the compatibility of potential matches based on features such as demographic information, interests, values, and compatibility scores derived from user interactions.

# Deep Learning:
 Deep learning techniques, such as neural networks, could be used for more advanced matchmaking tasks, such as image recognition (for profile pictures) or semantic analysis of textual data.

# Ranking Algorithms:
 To prioritize and display potential matches to users, ranking algorithms are crucial. These algorithms take into account various factors, such as match compatibility, user preferences, and likelihood of mutual interest, to present the most relevant matches to each user.
