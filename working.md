 NLP techniques can be used to analyze and understand the textual information provided in user profiles, such as interests, hobbies, and personal descriptions. This information can then be used to match users with similar interests or personalities.

# Machine Learning Models:
 Shaadi.com likely employs various machine learning models to predict the compatibility of potential matches based on features such as demographic information, interests, values, and compatibility scores derived from user interactions.

# Deep Learning:
